This is a responsive webpage that utilizes html, css, and Javascript. It is a short timed quiz that gives you one point for every correct answer. Each incorrect answer subtracts 10 seconds from the timer. The quiz will continue to run till the timer reaches zero. This will continue to happen even if the user goes through all of the questions. This is to ensure retainability of the material. Once the quiz is fully finished it will prompt a request to put in your name to store in the high scores list. This will enable some competition with either themselves or other peers.
